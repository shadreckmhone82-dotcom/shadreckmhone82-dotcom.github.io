    <h2>“AND SUDDENLY”</h2>
    <p>
      And suddenly I was made free<br/>
      Suddenly he paid the fee<br/>
      For me to be whole again<br/>
      He took my pain
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he said let there be light<br/>
      And then suddenly I started seeing things right<br/>
      My past held me back for ages<br/>
      But he changed my story again
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me all you need is light to shine<br/>
      All you need to do is be mine<br/>
      He said and I believed<br/>
      Here I'm to testify that I'm his child
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly I felt a weight lift off my chest<br/>
      The darkness faded, and my soul found rest<br/>
      The light of his love shone bright and true<br/>
      And I knew in that moment, I was brand new
    </p>
    <p>
      He healed my wounds, he calmed my fears<br/>
      He gave me a voice, and wiped away my tears<br/>
      He showed me my worth, and my value too<br/>
      And I knew that I was loved, and that I was true
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly I stood up tall<br/>
      With a heart full of joy, and a spirit that would enthrall<br/>
      I walked in the light, with a newfound might<br/>
      And I shone with a radiance, that shone so bright
    </p>
